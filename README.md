# Harry_Potter_sorting_hat
A program that sorts students into Hogwarts houses using logistic regression and machine learning in ~10 variables. Along with a sequence of simple data visualization.

This is a first project I did in python and I took the oppotunity to explore various tools and packages in the field.
